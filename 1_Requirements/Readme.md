## SWOT ANALYSIS
![SWOT Analysis](https://github.com/arc-arnob/LnT_Mini_Project/blob/main/1_Requirements/swot.png)

# 4W&#39;s and 1&#39;H

## Who:
* Small and medium size clinics Providing Covid vaccinations to patients

## What:
* Many Clinics are not able to afford high end HMS or ERP systems and hence still depend on manual filing systems. During COVID vaccinations it becomes a tedious task to manage every patient with hand written file system

## When:
* This problem began in February 2021, when COVID Vaccination Drive began and small/medium clinics will soon have to administer vaccinations to people.

## Where:
* This problem is expected to surface in all states of India.

## How:
* This problem may cause ineffective vaccine management and hence there can be a huge amount of vaccine wastage. As per recent data in cities like Noida and Delhi till date 9%-18% vaccines have gone to waste.
